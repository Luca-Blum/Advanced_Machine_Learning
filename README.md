# Advanced Machine Learning

## Purpose
This repository is used for the development of the projects for the Advanced Machine Learning course of  Prof. Joachim M. Buhmann lectured at ETH ZÃ¼rich during the autumn semester 2020.

## Task 0
Dummy task to get familiar with the project system and to develop a basic template for frequently used functionalities like input/output, splitting data in train and test set and building a simple neural network.

## [Task 1](https://github.com/lblum95/AML/blob/master/task1/README.md)
This task has problems concerning:
- **Incomplete data** &rightarrow; Grouping and averaging
- **Outlier detection** &rightarrow; [Isolation Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html)
- **Feature selection** &rightarrow; [KBest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html)

We managed to solve these problems good enough to pass the hardest baseline.
## [Task 2](https://github.com/lblum95/AML/blob/master/task2/README.md)
This task has problems concerning:
- **Imbalanced data** &rightarrow; [SMOTE](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html)
- **Sensitive score** &rightarrow; [Stratified KFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html)

We managed to solve these problems exceptionally well, such that placed third on that homework. &#129395;
